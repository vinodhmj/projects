[[file:vs2.png]]

Plot, on one figure, the voltage magnitude at bus 4 as a function of the total system active
power load.[3 marks]
Compare the curves and discuss the influence of the load model used. [3 marks]
*** Observations
1. The impedance curve is linear whereas power curve bends towards the nose point
2. The active power in the system  can only be increased to an extent in
   constant power model
3. Impedance model keeps the ratio constant by reducing the voltage

* Large Disturbance Transient Stability Assessment
** Transient Stability without controls
#+caption: EMT Analysis of the system without controls
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.35\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.1.png]]
** Transient Stability with AVR activated
#+caption: EMT Analysis with AVR (Kavr = 100, Tavr = 0.05 s)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.35\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.2.png]]

1. AVR helps in transient stability of the system by adjusting the excitation voltage
2. AVR helps in reducing the initial rotor angle swing following the fault
3. This is accomplished by boosting the voltage applied to the field winding
   through the action of the amplifiers in the forward path of the voltage
   regulators. The increased air gap flux exerts a restraining torque on the
   rotor, which  tends to slow down its motion.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:freq}
Frequency = \frac{1}{(2 * t_{pp})} \\
\end{equation}
where, t_{pp} is the time between peak to peak angle of the final oscillation
within the simulation time.

** Effect of Automatic Voltage Regulator on System Stability
Varying the gain and time constant of for the previous system,

#+caption: EMT Analysis for AVR at [Kavr/Tavr = 20/0.5, 20/0.1, 200/0.1, 200/0.05] (Left to Right)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.7\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.3.png]]
*** Observations
1. Higher the AVR gain, higher the synchronising torque
2. Increasing AVR gain makes the system oscillate around the steady state
   value, but it introduces negative damping
3. Reducing time constant reduces the settling time and attains steady state
   quickly. Speed of the response high meaning system has to respond quickly
   which might not be ideal for Electro-mechanical systems
*** Optimal Combination 
The Kavr/Tavr of *200/0.1* is identified as optimal. The system with gain of 20,
tries to settle around a new operating point, so Kavr = 200 is
preferred. Response time of 0.05 is high for slow Electro-mechanical
systems. Hence Tavr=0.1 is preferred.
** System Controls and Modal Analysis
*** EMT Analysis by increasing the fault duration towards Instability
The figure below shows the generator response for the following cases
1. Constant excitation - System without AVR or PSS
   - Fault is cleared at 0.22s and at 0.23s
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 30ms
2. AVR activated (Kavr = 100, Tavr = 0.05s)
   - Fault is cleared at 0.28s, and at 0.34s
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 140ms
3. AVR and PSS activated (Kpss = 5, T1/T2 = 0.6/0.65, T3/T4 = 0.3/0.01)
   - Fault is cleared at 0.28s, and at 1.03 sec
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 840s

#+NAME:24abc

[[file:screenshots/2.4abc.png]]
*** Effect of fault clearing times on System Stability
Critical clearing time is the maximum elapsed time from the initiation of a
fault until its isolation such that the system is transiently stable.

1. The quicker the fault is cleared, faster system returns to stable operating point
2. With AVR added, the system can afford longer time before it collapses to
   instability, but this causes negative damping
3. AVR with PSS, enables the longer clearing times and increases the damping
*** Frequency of the critical mode
Using the equation \eqref{eq:freq} , the frequency of critical modes are
calculated as follows:
#+caption: Frequency of critical mode

| t_{pp} (sec)   | 2.89 - 2.279 = 0.6126 | 9.367 - 8.524 = 0.843 | 8.846 - 7.475 = 1.371 |

|----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
*** Damping of the critical mode for system without controls
Using logarithmic decrement method and considering two successive peaks,
If x1 is the first Maximum Peak Overshoot amplitude and x2 is the successive
peak overshoot amplitude, then:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:logdecdelta}
\delta = \ln \frac{x1}{x2}
\end{equation}

The damping ratio is then found by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logdeczeta}
\zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{2\pi}{\delta})^2}}
\end{equation}

For x1 = 10.2 degrees and x2 = 0.6 degrees, \delta = 2.833;

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.6\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.5.png]]
*** Observations
1. PSS is used to avoid subsequent signal variation after first swing control by
   AVR
2. PSS increases the damping torque and hence the damping of the system and
   reduces the synchronising torque to and extent
3. System bandwidth is also reduced
** Effect of Fault Location on System Stability

1. Farther the fault, more power is transferred into the system and is hence
   is subtracted from the power input to the generator
2. When more power is transferred to the system during the fault, the lower the
   acceleration of the machine rotor and greater the degree of stability
** Effect of Initial generator loading on System Stability

[[file:screenshots/2.7.png]]
*** Observations
1. Higher the initial loading, higher the system instability
2. The starting rotor angle magnitude is large initial loading is high
3. System inertia is reduced if the power rating at the start is high

*** Observations
1. Smaller the H, larger the angular swing during any time interval
2. If the Inertia constant of the system generators are decreased, the frequency
   variation will be high in the system
3. Higher rate of change of frequency will push the system stability into

* Conclusion
Power System, in terms of Voltage Stability and Rotor Angle stability was
analysed and experimented on a test model using DigSilent PowerFactory software.
Voltage Stability depends on the Reactive power. The type of load modelling has
a profound impact on the analysis. Rotor Angle stability concerns with the Real
Power transfer in the system and its effect. The stability and damping improves
significantly with Negative feedback and control parameters. Generator
properties and system loading and Fault characteristics affects the stability in
general.
