#+RESULTS:
[[file:vs2.png]]

Plot, on one figure, the voltage magnitude at bus 4 as a function of the total system active
power load.[3 marks]
Compare the curves and discuss the influence of the load model used. [3 marks]
*** Observations
1. The impedance curve is linear whereas power curve bends towards the nose point
2. The active power in the system  can only be increased to an extent in
   constant power model
3. Impedance model keeps the ratio constant by reducing the voltage

* Large Disturbance Transient Stability Assessment
** Transient Stability without controls
#+caption: EMT Analysis of the system without controls
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.35\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.1.png]]
** Transient Stability with AVR activated
#+caption: EMT Analysis with AVR (Kavr = 100, Tavr = 0.05 s)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.35\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.2.png]]

1. AVR helps in transient stability of the system by adjusting the excitation voltage
2. AVR helps in reducing the initial rotor angle swing following the fault
3. This is accomplished by boosting the voltage applied to the field winding
   through the action of the amplifiers in the forward path of the voltage
   regulators. The increased air gap flux exerts a restraining torque on the
   rotor, which  tends to slow down its motion.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:freq}
Frequency = \frac{1}{(2 * t_{pp})} \\
\end{equation}
where, t_{pp} is the time between peak to peak angle of the final oscillation
within the simulation time.

** Effect of Automatic Voltage Regulator on System Stability
For the system of part 2.2 and the fault details from part 2.1, vary the gain
and time constant of the AVRs using the following pairs for Kavr and Tavr:

#+caption: EMT Analysis for AVR at [Kavr/Tavr = 20/0.5, 20/0.1, 200/0.1, 200/0.05] (Left to Right)
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.7\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.3.png]]
*** Observations
1. Higher the AVR gain, higher the synchronising torque, 
2. Increasing AVR gain, makes the system oscillate around the steady state value But it introduces negative damping
3. Reducing time constant reduces the settling time and attains steady state
   quickly. Speed of the response high meaning system has to respond quickly
   which might not be ideal for electro-mechanical systems
*** Optimal Combination 
system and justify your selection (choose an ‘optimal’ combination only from the
parameter set-pairs provided)
200/0.5
** System Controls and Modal Analysis
*** EMT Analysis by increasing the fault duration towards Instability
The figure below shows the generator response for the following cases
1. Constant excitation
   - System without AVR or PSS
   - Fault is cleared at 0.22s and at 0.23s
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 30ms
2. AVR activated
   - Kavr = 100, Tavr = 0.05s
   - Fault is cleared at 0.28s, and at 0.34s
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 140ms
3. AVR and PSS activated
   - Kavr = 100, Tavr = 0.05s, Kpss = 5, T1/T2 = 0.6/0.65, T3/T4 = 0.3/0.01
   - Fault is cleared at 0.28s, and at 1.03 sec
   - The critical fault clearing time before system loses stability is 840s

#+NAME:24abc

[[file:screenshots/2.4abc.png]]

*** Effect of fault clearing times on System Stability
Critical clearing time is the maximum elapsed time from the initiation of a
fault until its isolation such that the system is transiently stable.

1. The quicker the fault is cleared, faster system returns to stable operating point
2. With AVR added, the system can afford longer time before it collapses to
   instability, but this causes negative damping
3. AVR with PSS, enables the longer clearing times and increases the damping
*** Frequency of the critical mode
Using the equation \eqref{eq:freq} , the frequency of critical modes are
calculated as follows:
#+caption: Frequency of critical mode
#+name:frequencycritical
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :center t :align |c|l|l|l|
|----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
|                | Constant excitation   | AVR                   | AVR and PSS           |
|----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
| t_{pp} (sec)   | 2.89 - 2.279 = 0.6126 | 9.367 - 8.524 = 0.843 | 8.846 - 7.475 = 1.371 |
|----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
| Frequency (Hz) | 0.8162                | 0.593                 | 0.365                 |
|----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
*** Damping of the critical mode for system without controls
Using logarithmic decrement method and considering two successive peaks,
If x1 is the first Maximum Peak Overshoot amplitude and x2 is the successive
peak overshoot amplitude, then:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:logdecdelta}
\delta = \ln \frac{x1}{x2}
\end{equation}

The damping ratio is then found by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logdeczeta}
\zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{2\pi}{\delta})^2}}
\end{equation}

For x1 = 10.2 degrees and x2 = 0.6 degrees, \delta = 2.833;
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Damping ratio, \zeta = 0.411
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center

*** Eigen Values
Determine the order of the mathematical model of the system (size of the system state
matrix) 
- 17 x 17
- 21 x 21
- 27 x 27
Determine the order of the mathematical model of the AVRs and PSSs included in the
system. Consider that the AVR and PSS of all generators are of the same type
(same order).
10 x 10

For case (a), identify the electromechanical modes of the system and provide their frequency,
and damping, with 3 decimal points precision. [2 marks]
For cases (b) and (c), estimate/identify the electromechanical modes and provide their
frequency, with 3 decimal points precision. Briefly state your criteria for the
estimation/identification

** Effect of Power System Stabilisers on System Stability

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.7\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.5.png]]

Discuss briefly the influence of the PSS gain on system stability.
1. It increases the damping torque and hence the damping of the system
2. It reduces the synchronising torque
3. Bandwidth will also be brought down
** Effect of Fault Location on System Stability
#+caption: EMT Analysis Fault location
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.7\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.6.png]]

1. Farther the fault, more power is transferred into the system and is hence
   is subtracted from the power input to the generator. The more power is
   transferred to the system during the fault, the lower the acceleration of the
   machine rotor and greater the degree of stability.
** Effect of Initial generator loading on System Stability
#+caption: EMT Generator Initial Loading
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :height 0.7\textwidth :center t
[[file:screenshots/2.7.png]]

Higher the initial loading, unstable the system gets.
