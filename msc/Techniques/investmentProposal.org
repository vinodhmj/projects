* Executive Summary
The aviation industry is transitioning towards a clean energy future in the form
of electric aircraft. G8 Power is a highly valued start-up company in the
e-aviation domain. The company was founded by six MSc students from the
University of Manchester with the mission:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"/Fly towards a sustainable green future/".
#+END_QUOTE

*Product* : E8 engine, the flagship product is an electric aircraft engine that can be
configured into three modes called Mini, Pro and Pro Max, to cater to varying
requirements in the industry.

*IP* : G8 Power has filed a patent for the Wired Takeoff(WTO) system, while another
family of patent applications has been filed for the Power System design of the
E8 engine.

*Business Model* : The Business is phased into three stages Phase 1,
Business-to-Business(B2B), for drone delivery applications planes. Phase 2, B2B,
engines for other aircraft companies, and Phase 3 Business-to-Consumer
Service(B2C) as a domestic airline services.

*Funding* : 

*ROI* : Riptron’s early revenue streams
* Introduction
The future of aviation is electric, is safe statement. This is proposed as need
rather than a luxury.  Electric aircraft are driven by multiple electric motors
which use electricity as its fuel, from sources like Battery, Solar cells, Wind
turbines or Fuel Cells. The technology is at its incubation stage due to
technological limitation now, but is rapidly changing, and is expected to see
its growth stage in the next decade. The following image shows a Word Cloud
generated from articles about future of Aviation Industry and contains the
keywords in the industry now. The aviation market had a slump during the
COVID-19 years but is picking up the pace. The market forecast for the next
decade and further is promising for the aviation sector and particularly,
electric aircraft

* Company, Project and Intellectual Property
** G8 Power
G8 Power is a highly valued start-up company in the Electric Aviation
domain. The company was founded by six MSc students from the University of
Manchester in 2021 after winning the first prize in the Tech Crunch competition
for the most promising e-aircraft engine design prototype. The company is
focused on delivering high-performance all-electric engines to other airline
businesses. Currently based out of the United Kingdom, the company expects to
increase its global presence in the next decade.

** E8 Engine
The G8 Power company has developed three types of electric engines to cater to
varying requirements in the industry:

#+caption: E8 Engines
#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.3 :placement [H] 
[[file:minipromax.png]]

_*E8 MINI*_ A high-performance small scale
electric rotor engine for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) applications and drone
deliveries

_*E8 PRO*_
An electric aircraft engine system for narrow-body planes with less than 10
passengers, including confidential business jets and emergency services

_*E8 PRO MAX*_
A modularized electric aircraft engine with the distributed propulsion system
and hybrid generation, including solar sheets and micro wind generation. This is
envisaged as the engine for passenger aircraft in the commercial aviation sector
with a capacity up to 75 passengers

** Intellectual Property
G8 Power has secured the intellectual property of a patent application at the
Intellectual Property Office, United Kingdom in December 2020, for the first
generation E8 engines which are scale-able and can be repurposed for drones,
light and commercial aircraft applications.

G8 Power another disruptive innovation patent applied for Wired Take-off system,
in collaboration with the University of Manchester in April 2021. 

In March 2022 we received official guarantee declaration from the Intellectual
Property Office for the above two patents, and a new patent application was
submitted for the On-The-Go RTPV Solar sheet and micro-wind generation technologies.

* Market and Competition
This study provides insights into making electric aviation a technologically and economically
viable project. The scope and need are identified and is often amplified as the need of the hour.
The opportunities are immense at each level of market including the production, supply chain,
market penetration and customer services. The growth of air traffic in coming decades also adds
to the possibilities in the future. Following are the key observations:
- Once the technology matures, market will respond immediately. Appropriate
  business models must be made as due diligence
- Research into technologies like Battery, aerodynamics, micro-renewable
  integration needs to prioritised
- Demographically, the scope for electric aircrafts in high in both developing
  and developed segments
- Electric engine technology can be scaled into different aircraft segments from
  drones to passenger aircraft
#+caption: Market Size, By Region
#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.3 :placement [H] 
[[file:marketsize.png]]
** Market Dynamics and Segmentation
By aircraft type, commercial aircraft is currently dominating the market and is
still expected to grow. Airbus expects to deliver 720 commercial aircrafts by
the end of 2022.  Boeing and Airbus deliveries increased from 2021, where 22 and
49 commercial jets were delivered in February 2022, compared to 22 and 32
deliveries, respectively, in February 2021 [2]. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and
private jets also has an upward slope projected for the next decades.

Geographically, the largest aviation markets for the projected period are
expected to be in the Asia-Pacific region including the Middle East and Africa,
with India and China being the largest markets. China had surpassed the United
States’ aviation market in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it
had on the United States’ drop in passenger traffic [3]. According to Boeing,
due to the rising demand in commercial air travel demand, Chinese airlines will
potentially require around 8700 new planes by 2040 valued at $1.5 trillion.
Regarding India, the high domestic demand for flights expects a fast recovery of
the passenger traffic, in addition to the permission for domestic flights to
operate at maximum capacity.  Overall, aviation industries in this region are
expected to recover faster than other regions due to the relatively larger
domestic demand. The established markets are also expected to grow at a steady
rate in the following 2 decades.

[[file:segmentation.png]]
** Competition
In the current scenario, electric aircraft engines are supplied by well-known
aircraft engine suppliers such as General Electric, Rolls-Royce and Safran.
Aircraft-makers like Airbus and Boeing are also venturing in electric jet
engines. At the same time, there are several new entrants. Tesla is currently
developing its own electric plane.  Eviation is a company founded in Israel,
unveiled the Alice, an all-electric nine-seater regional jet, at the 53rd Paris
Air Show. MagniX is a company based in Seattle, USA. The company mainly supplies
electric engines for small aircraft. Ampaire is a company focused on hybrid
aircraft engine. Their product is called EEL with engine range of 200 miles.
Pipistrel is another company developing all aircraft engines.

* Go To Market Strategy
#+caption: Business Strategy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.3 :placement [H] 
[[file:b2c.png]]
The company will manufacture and test the flagship engine E8, its Power system,
Battery System, Backup Hydrogen generator, Solar and wind generation systems,
wired take-off system, and controllers.

In the first stage, for items delivery and transport, the company will run with
B2C (Business-to-Consumer Service) strategy and sell the product, the
mini-engine system for zipline drones, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) and small
commercial planes to transport and delivery companies, like Amazon, Royal Mail,
DHL etc., especially for undeveloped countries or areas where the transportation
industry is undeveloped.

In the second stage, the engines will be sold to the cooperate companies to
enable them to run their aircraft with E8 Engines. The company will run as B2B
(Business-to-Business Service). The company will look to create life-long
relationships with other businesses and will help them to become successful.

In the third stage in the future, once the company is established in the market
and considerable income is earned to become self-sustainable, G8 Power will
manufacture the whole aircraft by itself and start domestic airline services and
return to B2C (Business-to-Consumer Service).
