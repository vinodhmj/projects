* Executive Summary
The aviation industry is transitioning towards a clean energy future in the form
of electric aircraft. G8 Power is a highly valued start-up company in the
e-aviation domain. The company was founded by six MSc students from the
University of Manchester with the mission:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"/Fly towards a sustainable green future/".
#+END_QUOTE

E8 engine, the flagship product is an electric aircraft engine that can be
configured into three modes called Mini, Pro and Pro Max. G8 Power has filed a
patent for the Wired Takeoff(WTO) system, while another family of patent
applications has been filed waiting approval.The Business is phased into three
stages Phase 1, B2B, for drone delivery applications planes. Phase 2, B2B,
engines for other aircraft companies, and Phase 3 B2C as a domestic airline
services.

G8 Power has raised $500000 in total funding. G8 Power's current valuation is $2
million, The six founding members of the company currently control 72% majority
of the shares. The company is offering 25-30% of its shares in Equity for
investment and long-term partnerships. Primary revenue sources would be sales of
Mini and Pro engines. Secondary sources are IP Licensing and reuse. G8 Power
expects to break even at the end of third year and is expecting growth at a rate
of 10%

Flying towards a green future, G8 Power is proud of its current partnerships and
is confident in inviting new investors for long term partnership.

* Introduction, Company, Project and Intellectual Property
Electric aircraft are driven by multiple electric motors which use electricity
as its fuel, from sources like Battery, Solar cells, Wind turbines or Fuel
Cells. The technology is at its incubation stage now, but is rapidly growing.

** G8 Power
G8 Power is a highly valued start-up company in the Electric Aviation
domain. The company was founded by six MSc students from the University of
Manchester in 2021 after winning the first prize in the Tech Crunch competition
for the most promising e-aircraft engine design prototype. The company is
focused on delivering high-performance all-electric engines to other airline
businesses. Currently based out of the United Kingdom, the company expects to
increase its global presence in the next decade.

** E8 Engine
The G8 Power company has developed three types of electric engines to cater to
varying requirements in the industry. \autoref{fig:section2} shows the various engines.

_*E8 MINI*_ A high-performance small scale
electric rotor engine for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) applications and drone
deliveries

_*E8 PRO*_
An electric aircraft engine system for narrow-body planes with less than 10
passengers, including confidential business jets and emergency services

_*E8 PRO MAX*_
A modularized electric aircraft engine with the distributed propulsion system
and hybrid generation, including solar sheets and micro wind generation. This is
envisaged as the engine for passenger aircraft in the commercial aviation sector
with a capacity up to 75 passengers
** Intellectual Property
G8 Power has secured the intellectual property of a patent application at the
Intellectual Property Office, United Kingdom in December 2020, for the first
generation E8 engines which are scale-able and can be repurposed for drones,
light and commercial aircraft applications.

G8 Power another disruptive innovation patent applied for Wired Take-off system,
in collaboration with the University of Manchester in April 2021. 

In March 2022 we received official guarantee declaration from the Intellectual
Property Office for the above two patents, and a new patent application was
submitted for the On-The-Go RTPV Solar sheet and micro-wind generation technologies.

* Market and Competition
The opportunities are immense at each level of market including the production,
supply chain, market penetration and customer services. The growth of air
traffic in coming decades also adds to the possibilities in the future. Once the
technology matures, market will respond immediately. Appropriate business models
must be made as due diligence. Research into technologies like Battery,
aerodynamics, micro-renewable integration needs to prioritised.

By aircraft type, commercial aircraft is currently dominating the market and is
still expected to grow. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and private jets also has an
upward slope projected for the next decades. Geographically, the largest
aviation markets for the projected period are expected to be in the Asia-Pacific
region including the Middle East and Africa, with India and China being the
largest markets.Overall, aviation industries in this region are expected to
recover faster than other regions due to the relatively larger domestic
demand. The established markets are also expected to grow at a steady rate in
the following 2 decades.
** Competition
In the current scenario, electric aircraft engines are supplied by well-known
aircraft engine suppliers such as General Electric, Rolls-Royce.
Aircraft-makers like Airbus and Boeing are also venturing in electric jet
engines. At the same time, there are several new entrants. Tesla is currently
developing its own electric plane.  _Eviation_ is a company founded in Israel,
unveiled the Alice, an all-electric nine-seater regional jet, at the 53rd Paris
Air Show. _MagniX_ is a company based in Seattle, USA. The company mainly supplies
electric engines for small aircraft. _Ampaire_ is a company focused on hybrid
aircraft engine. Their product is called EEL with engine range of 200 miles.
_Pipistrel_ is another company developing all aircraft engines.

* Go To Market Strategy
The company will manufacture and test the flagship engine E8, its Power system,
Battery System, Backup Hydrogen generator, Solar and wind generation systems,
wired take-off system, and controllers. In the first stage, for items delivery
and transport, the company will run with B2C (Business-to-Consumer Service)
strategy and sell the product, the mini-engine system for zipline drones, UAV
(unmanned aerial vehicles) and small commercial planes to transport and delivery
companies, like Amazon, Royal Mail, DHL etc., especially for undeveloped
countries or areas where the transportation industry is undeveloped.

#+caption: Business model
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./b2c.png]]

In the second stage, the engines will be sold to the cooperate companies to
enable them to run their aircraft with E8 Engines. The company will run as B2B
(Business-to-Business Service). The company will look to create life-long
relationships with other businesses and will help them to become successful.

In the third stage in the future, once the company is established in the market
and considerable income is earned to become self-sustainable, G8 Power will
manufacture the whole aircraft by itself and start domestic airline services and
return to B2C (Business-to-Consumer). Furthermore:â€‹

- Sell toy drones
- Mediate between companies and governmentsâ€‹
- Participate and promote in climate agreements and air-showsâ€‹
- Target billionaires and celebrities for Private e-Jetsâ€‹
- Partner with drone chassis companiesâ€‹â€‹
â€‹
* Financial Projections
The projection for the next four years is shown in the images below. G8 early
income are expected to be from IP sales. This along with the Capital investment
from shareholders makes a stable first year. Second year sees loss, which is
expected to recover in the third year. We break even in the third year.

In terms of Market segmentation, first couple of years the Mini engine will be
on for sale. When the Pro engine sales kick in at the end of third year, jump in
revenue is expected. It is at the third year G8 is planning to expand in number
and geographical locations. Negotiations for the second year sales are ongoing. 
Third and Fourth year sales are in planning stage.
