While there is a great deal of debate about Vertical Takeoff and Landing(VTOL)
for electric aircraft taxis in urban areas, Wired Takeoff(WT) system for an electric
plane is a novelty. An electric aircraft carrying around 50 passengers might be
too big for VTOL. The idea behind WT is that of optimising the utilisation of
battery system on the aircraft. Flight takeoff demands lot of energy, batteries
have low energy density. So, if the aircraft is connected to the grid as long as
it is on the ground would help a great deal in reducing the battery size. 

The power cable could be manually connected to the plane before takeoff and
electromechanically disengaged at the end of runway with cable uncoiling and
recoiling like a tape measure. Another method is to have rail section on the
runway similar to Catapult takeoff in Naval aircrafts that takeoff from a
carrier vessel. Runways will have to be equipped with a high priority mini power
system matching the requirements. The electric connection could be disengaged
right before the takeoff and aircraft could be switched to battery power source 
to avoid arcing while disengaging the cord. 


The use of electricity for aircraft propulsion was first experimented with during the development of the airship in
