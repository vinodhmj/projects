* Executive Summary
The need for proliferation of low-carbon technologies for a sustainable future
is demanding innovative strategies for integrating renewable energy generation
into the existing power ecosystem. This is to either replace the conventional
power plants or to enable coexistence with them. The challenges associated with
renewable integration are multi-faceted, and could be broadly categorised into
Social, Technical and Economical challenges. Social challenge demands power
security and acceptance; Lights must be always on. Emergency services like
quick-response reserve power plants are needed for this. Technical challenges
are associated with the capacity of the grid and idiosyncrasies of the
generating units. Renewable integration should be economically feasible for both
suppliers and end users. 

In this experiment, the aforementioned challenges are studied in the test case
to identify optimal solutions for Summer and Winter load profiles. Power world
software is used to model and perform the analysis. Wind and Solar integration
is studied at different output level are studied. Optimal Power Flow(OPF) which
proposes the optimal generation power dispatch to the loads by balancing the
demand, minimising the cost and not overloading the network constraints is run
for different load and generation scenarios. Contingency analysis is also
performed to deal with worst case network capabilities to maintain the security
of the system. This is called Security Constrained OPF(SCOPF). Furthermore, the
idea of standing reserve instead of spinning reserve is analysed. The effect of
increasing the transmission line capacity is also studied. 

In summary of results, incorporating clean energy generation like Wind and Solar
without compromising the system security has major economic benefits. With
flexible generation options, standing reserve and increased transmission
capacity, conventional coal power plants could be decommissioned and be
effectively replaced by clean energy technologies.
* Data and Assumptions
** Important Assumptions
- For System Security, all units except High-flex CCGT and OCGT units are kept
  online all times and would produce at least the minimum stable generation
- Wind generation could be dispatched in proportions, whereas Solar(RTPV) output
  cannot be controlled
- Nuclear Generation is assumed to be running at full capacity all the time to
  provide base load. Nuclear is not curtailed under any circumstances. 
** Load
Heating and Cooling power demands are provided in the question as MW_h. The
Coefficient of Performance(COP) is also given for the above demands. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{MW_e}{MW_h} = \frac{1}{COP}
\end{equation}

The electrical equivalent load is hence calculated as:

** Case b : Total Hourly Electricity Costs 
Procedure:
Solar is disconnected from the system and Wind runs at 0% and 100% output. The
load and reserve details are present in tables [[electricalload]] and
[[systemreserve]] respectively. The hourly cost and Wind curtailment power is
recorded below

*** Observations
1. *COST* : In summer, there is a 7% decrease in the hourly running cost with
   Wind generation and the in the winter there 28% decrease
2. *CO_2 Reduction* : 20% reduction in both summer and winter is identified
3. *Curtailment* : In summer, even though Wind generation is available, 80% of
   the generation has to be curtailed due to system security requirements and
   less demand. Hi-flex CCGT generators must run at its minimum generation
   capacity in order to provide system security. In winter, where the demand is
   high, only 30% of the Wind is curtailed
* Inflexibility and operational issues
** 100% Wind and Solar power generation

*** Slack Node
In power system analysis Slack Node is an imaginary bus used to balance the
power flow in the system. This is theoretical concept where a large generator or
Grid in-feed is modelled to provide/absorb the power imbalance in the system. 

In \autoref{fig:section2}, the slack bus is seen to absorb the extra power
flowing in the system. It is absorbing 350MW and 200MW in Summer and Winter
respectively. Following are the reasons why there is a negative flow into the
Slack generator:

1. The equality constraint of optimisation problem is violated by forcing 100%
   Wind and 100% Solar integration. The generation is higher than the demand in
   the system
2. RTPV solar generation cannot be controlled and curtailed. Wind generation can
   be curtailed, but in the experiment Wind is forced at 100%
3. In the above case, the renewable generation accounts to almost 90% of the
   demand. The system operator has mandated reserve according to table
   [[systemreserve]], and high-flex CCGT units must produce Minimum Stable
   Generation(MSG). For system security, all the units are assumed to be online
   causing MSG of all the units mandatory. These causes the imbalance in supply
   demand equation
4. The line from Bus 1 to Bus 2 is overloaded because he slack bus is forced to
   absorb the extra generation

*** Potential solutions
Wind could be curtailed, but Solar cannot be dispatched or curtailed.  Wind and
Solar is considered intermittent and hence needs all the other generators to be
online for system security. With BESS, renewables could have a buffer and
conventional generators like Coal power plants could be made obsolete.

#+END_SRC

_*Justification*_
- Wind is dispatchable and hence can be curtailed as per demand
- Decommissioning coal plants - One of the prime reasons for integrating
  renewable energy is to reduce carbon emissions. Coal plants could be safely
  removed from the system by retaining CCGT units which are considered cleaner
  compared to coal
- In the worst case winter, there is still ample generation capacity to deal
  with any increase in load. There is 120MW Wind, and 80MW CCGT. That accounts
  to about 30% of the installed capacity excluding the High-flex reserve and
  Slack OCGT
- Coal plants could be made online in case of anticipated increase in load for
  example a Football final game
* Security Constrained OPF (SCOPF)
Contingency analysis is performed to maintain system security during unexpected
events in Power System assets. Transmission lines are particularly vulnerable to
weather and vandalism. In this section, instead of running the best case OPF,
the worst case SCOPF with pre-defined contingency is performed.
** Observations
- _For both cases in Summer, and 0% Wind generation of Winter, SCOPF results are
  exactly same as that of OPF_ as shown in Table [[opf]] and Figure [[fig:1b]]
- For Winter, and Wind at 100% generation, dispatchable, the following is the
  cost has a 22% increase from 22389\pounds/hr to 27204\pounds/hr as shown in
  the figure below
- The contingency used in this analysis is of N-1 nature, which effectively
  reduces the power transfer capacity of the transmission line
- If the system load was distributed to Bus 2 where renewable and Nuclear is
  connected, then higher renewable integration could have been achieved

* Flexibility options in OPF and SCOPF
** Flexible OPF
To make the system more flexible in terms of integrating clean energy
technologies, curtailing CCGT generation units with Coal generation present and
absent are experimented. Following are the observations:
- _75% of CCGT at Bus 3 and 50% at bus 4 are curtailed_ by reducing the number
 of generation units online
- The transmission capacity of line 2-3 is the primary roadblock in evacuating
  Wind power
- The MSG of coal plant at bus 2 is adds to the transmission line load
- Removing coal plant at bus 3 increases the Wind generation, _decreases cost_ and
  improves clean energy generation
- _No risk_ is expected considering almost 250MW of installed capacity excluding
  RTPV and OCGT, and including reserve is kept as a buffer

** Flexible SCOPF
SCOPF introduces transmission line constraints, so, curtailing CCGT generation
units is not an option. Hence, curtailing Coal generation present and absent are
experimented.

\end{figure}
#+END_SRC
Following are the observations:
- _Reserve is not adequate_ as per System Operator requirements but, the Wind
  Generation is expected to be half the installed capacity
- CCGT and Reserve is initialised  at full specifications
- The transmission capacity of line 2-3 is the primary roadblock in evacuating
  power from Wind generating station. The MSG of coal plant at bus 2 is adds to
  the transmission line load
- The transmission line capacity should be increased from line 2-3 in order to
  be able to increase Wind energy evacuation
- Removing coal plant at bus 3 increases the Wind generation, _decreases cost
  and improves clean energy generation_
- There is a minimum risk associated with the reserve even though Wind
  generation is expected to be less than half. This could arise from _N-2
  contingency_ for line 2-3, as all the loads are connected in bus 3 and 4
** Standing Reserve
As mentioned in the previous sections, lack of adequate spinning reserve as per
the System Operator requirements is a concern. Assuming that all reserve
could be provided by the OCGT units as standing reserve, following are the
observations:
- Wind energy integration into the system could be increased
  1. OPF : increased to 90% from 70%
  2. SCOPF: increased to 45% from 31% 
- The MSG needed for spinning reserves(90MW) could be replaced with Wind
  Power. This constitutes of 15% of the load forecast for winter
- In OPF, both conventional coal plants causing _carbon emission could be
  decommissioned_ with 200MW buffer plus OCGT reserve
- In SCOPF, decommissioning Coal plant at bus 2 is the optimal configuration

*** Cost
- Adopting Standing reserve instead of spinning reserve would add a _cost
  benefit_ at _6%_ in OPF and _4%_ in SCOPF
- Removal of both Coal plants in OPF has a slight insignificant increase in
  cost, whereas removal of coal plant at Bus 2 for SCOPF has a decrease in
  overall price
** Increasing Line Capacity
In transmission expansion planning, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to
decide if the line capacity is to be increased. In this case, when the line
capacity is increased to 150MW each between bus 2 and 3 and OPF and SCOPF
analysis is conducted. Following are the observations:

- In _OPF, only 1.5% increase_ in wind generation is noticed, whereas in _SCOPF
  almost 42% increase_ in wind generation in observed
- The _loads are located at different buses_ than where Wind generation is
  located. This means transmission line capacity is important to evacuate power
  to the consumer location
- Contingency analysis disables a parallel line in a double transmission line
  circuit, which effectively reduces the ampacity of the line. With increased
  line capacity, more power generated in the wind could be transferred to the
  load 
- There is a _6% reduction in hourly cost_ for SCOPF

* Conclusion
The purpose of this laboratory exercise was to find optimal solutions to
integrate clean renewable technologies for Summer and Winter load profiles with
and without contingency measures. Hourly cost of energy transactions are
recorded. Power world software was used to model and perform the analysis. Wind
and Solar integration is studied at different output level are studied. 

It was identified that incorporating clean energy generation like Wind and Solar
without compromising the system security has major economic benefits. With
flexible generation options, standing reserve and increased transmission
capacity, conventional coal power plants could be decommissioned and be
effectively replaced by clean energy technologies.
