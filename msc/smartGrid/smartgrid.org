* Executive Summary
The need for proliferation of low-carbon technologies for a sustainable future
is demanding disruptive innovative strategies to be integrate renewable energy 
generation into the existing units to either replace the conventional power
plants or to co-exist with them. The challenges associated with renewable
integration are multi-faceted. This could be broadly categorised into Social,
Technical and Economical challenges. Social challenge demands power security;
Lights must be always on. Emergency services like quick-response reserve power
plants are needed for this. Technical challenges are associated with the
capacity of the grid and idiosyncrasies of the generating units. 

In this experiment, the aforementioned challenges are studied in the test case
to identify optimal solutions for different scenarios of load and generation.
Contingency analysis is also performed to deal with worst case situations. 
Power world software is used to model and perform Optimal Power Flow Analysis. 

* Data and Assumptions
** Important Assumptions
- For System Security, all units except High-flex CCGT and OCGT units are kept
  online all times and would produce at least the minimum stable generation
- Wind generation could be dispatched in proportions, whereas Solar(RTPV) output
  cannot be controlled
** Load
Heating and Cooling power demands are provided in the question as MW_h. The
Coefficient of Performance(COP) is also given for the above demands. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{MW_e}{MW_h} = \frac{1}{COP}
\end{equation}

The electrical equivalent load is hence calculated as:

** Case b : Total Hourly Electricity Costs 
Procedure:
Solar is disconnected from the system and Wind runs at 0% and 100% output. The
load and reserve details are present in tables [[electricalload]] and
[[systemreserve]] respectively. The hourly cost and Wind curtailment power is
recorded below

*** Observations
1. *COST* : In summer, there is a 7% decrease in the hourly running cost with
   Wind generation and the in the winter there 28% decrease.
2. *CO_2 Reduction* : 20% reduction in both summer and winter is identified
3. *Curtailment* : In summer, even though Wind is available, 80% of the generation has to be
   curtailed due to system security requirements. Primarily due to less demand,
   the cost of running wind generator is slightly high. Hi-flex CCGT generators
   must run at its minimum generation capacity in order to provide system
   security. In winter, where the demand is high, only 30% of the Wind is curtailed, which
   reduces the hourly cost by 22% from the case where wind generation is
   disabled
* Inflexibility and operational issues

*** Summer
1. 100% wind generation and 100% Solar integration causes negative power flow into the
   slack bus
2. In theory, slack bus absorbs extra generation above the demand in this case,
   the summer load is less causing extra generation
3. The line from Bus 1 to Bus 2 is overloaded because he slack bus is forced to
   absorb the extra generation
4. As a potential solution, Wind could be curtailed, but Solar cannot be
   dispatched or curtailed.
5. Wind and Solar is considered intermittent and hence needs all the other
   generators to be online for system security. With BESS, renewables could have
   a buffer and conventional generators like CCGTs and Coal power plants could
   be made obsolete

c. Discuss and explain the flows at the slack node (e.g.: why are there negative flows or
why positive flows?) and their relationship with the level of integration of wind and
solar in the system. [6 marks]
d. Propose one generation flexibility solution to potentially avoid negative flows at the
slack and justify it with simulation/numerical results. In the case there are no such
negative flows elaborate on the reason for it. [10 marks]
e. Propose one solution to potentially avoid positive flows at the slack and justify it
with simulation/numerical results. In the case there are no such positive flows
elaborate on the reason for it. [10 marks]
Note: Your solutions should be realistic and feasible solutions – please provide brief justification
for the feasibility of the solution and briefly comment on the timescale, costs and risk involved
in the proposed solutions.

Consider a Security Constrained OPF with potential contingencies on the main lines.
(Hint: Run in PowerWorld a “SCOPF”. All line contingencies have already been recorded in
the file, so you do not have to change any settings.)
Assume 0% power output from solar plants.
For each of the two wind power output scenarios, 0% and 100%:
a. Using PowerWorld simulations, derive the total hourly electricity system costs and
the wind power curtailment corresponding to the winter and summer total
electricity demand levels based on Table 2. Include relevant screenshots from
PowerWorld showing the resulting electricity costs and wind power outputs. [14
marks]
b. Discuss and explain the main differences in results you see between the OPF
(considered in Question 1) and the SCOPF, with focus on the level of renewables you
can integrate in the system and the redispatch of generation plants (including the
utilization of CCGT in reserve). [6 marks]
* Flexibility options in OPF and SCOPF
Consider the case “Winter/100% wind/0% solar”.
a. How can you make the generation system more flexible to integrate more wind
power when running an OPF?

Assume that all reserve could be provided by the OCGT units at the slack, with no need to
operate high-flex CCGT at part load: the OCGT plants basically operate as “standing reserve”
by starting off and ramping up very fast if needed.

c. What are the wind integration benefits from using such standing reserve when using
an OPF and a SCOPF?

Comment and discuss the results, also in light of the costs of the two alternative
reserve strategies (part-loaded high-flex CCGT vs fast start OCGT modelled with
higher no-load cost. Start-up costs have not been modelled). [7 marks]
Assign back the provision of reserve to part-loaded high-flex CCGT, as from the beginning.
d. Increase the capacity of each of the two lines between Bus 2 and Bus 3 from 100
MW to 150 MW and run an OPF and a SCOPF. (Hint: double click on and open each
line’s window, and change the capacity settings).
Notice and explain why increasing the line capacity allows much more increase in
wind power integration when using a SCOPF than when using a simple OPF
