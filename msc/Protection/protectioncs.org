* Executive Summary
Electrical Power System needs protection from abnormal occurrences called faults
in the network. Different parts of the system are categorised into zones with
primary and backup protection equipment assigned for each zone. The protection
devices have built-in controls which is set by the user for it to identify
faults. These settings are crucial, because it helps discriminate between normal
condition and faulty condition. It should also prevent backup protection acting
ahead of primary protection. Incorrect settings could cause catastrophic
failures like system blackout, or permanent damage to large power system assets
and customer equipment. It could also prematurely disconnect sect of customers
at different zones. The study conducted in this project identifies the correct
relay settings for the system, and discusses the merits and disadvantages of
different combinations.  \\

Over-current protection technique is used to isolate the faults in the given
radial system by the client. Inverse Definite Minimum Time(IDMT) relays with
Current Transformers are used to measure current, identify threshold crossing,
and to send alarm signal during fault conditions. A Circuit Breaker(CB) receives
the signal and acts upon it to isolate affected part of the system from the
rest. At the leaf node of the system, fuses act as primary protection. The
upstream relays acts as backup protection for the fuses as well as the
downstream relays. The Plug Setting Multiplier(PSM) and Time Multiplier
Setting(TMS) in relays decide the time of relay operation. For the relays R, S
and T given in the client network, from upstream to downstream relays has PSM
325%, 550% and 725% chosen respectively. The TMS for the above relays, in a
standard inverse setting is identified as 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 respectively. The
fuses and relays are graded with respect to time and current. The calculations
are verified using PSCAD software simulations on model based power system
network. Graphs and tables supporting the studies are also incorporated in the
report.\\

Relay Coordination performed in this project has identified the necessary
control settings for the relays to ensure primary and backup protection and is
tested for different scenarios of fault magnitudes. 

* Introduction
** Over-Current Protection
Over Current Relay(OCR) protection is one of the oldest techniques in Power
System Protection. If magnitude of the current flowing in the system is above a
certain threshold, then the faulty section of the system is isolated within a
certain time frame. System current is measured using a Current Transformer(CT),
which reduces the current range to the relay specifications. The secondary
current of the CT is passed through a coil. The current carrying coil induces a
magnetic field which produces a mechanical torque on a metallic disc prodding it
into rotational motion. The mechanical torque on the disc is proportional to the
magnetic field, which is proportional to the current the coil is carrying. Under
normal operating conditions, the current magnitude is expected to be less than a
certain threshold; and a restraining spring holds the disc from motion. During
fault conditions, the current in the coil is expected to be high. Here, the
moving disc is expected to make contact with the tripping lead by overcoming the
restraining torque of the attached spring.
** Time and Distance
The aforementioned type of OCR is an instantaneous one. Further delay to relay
operations can be introduced by increasing the time taken to energise the relay
disc, or by increasing the distance between disc contact and tripping lead. The
former is achieved by adding resistance in front of the relay coil, thus forcing
it to demand more current from the CT to operate. The latter is achieved by
placing the tripping lead farther away from the disc contact. These settings are
conventionally called as Plug Setting Multiplier(PSM) and Time Multiplier
Setting (TMS) respectively.
* Standard IDMT Analysis
** Method and Assumptions
The relay coordination is performed by attempting to discriminate the operation
time of fuses and relays with respect to time and current. This is done for a
remote fault(farther away from relay) or a close-in/local fault(fault next to
the relay). As the protection grading moves from downstream to upstream, the
time of relay operation is expected to increase for a remote fault. For a
close-in fault, the relay would see high current immediately and the operation
time should be small.  This is achieved by PSM and TMS calculation using
Standard Inverse characteristics with the following assumptions:
- Higher values(above hundred) of current are rounded off to first significant figure
- Upstream relays are graded with respect to immediate downstream relays rather
  than the fuses
** Fuse Characteristics
#+caption: Fuse Characteristics

|--------------------+-------------|
| Operating time (s) | Current (A) |
|--------------------+-------------|
|               0.01 |         480 |

|                 10 |         105 |
|--------------------+-------------|
** Maximum Fault Current 
For a 11kV system, the maximum fault current at each bus, where X_n is the
magnitude of Thevinin impedance at the bus n, is calculated using the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
I_f = \frac{11000 \times 0.5774}{X_n}
\end{equation}
#+caption: Maximum fault current at each bus
#+name:faultcurrent
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :center t :align |c|c|
|------------+-------------|
| Bus number | Current (A) |
|------------+-------------|
|          4 |        1270 |
|          3 |        1587 |
|          2 |        2120 |
|          1 |        3180 |
|------------+-------------|
** Fuse at leaf node
For a load of 0.5MW @ 11kV and assuming a resistive load the max load current is
given by, 

\begin{align}\label{eq:loadcurrent}
I_{fusemax} 
&= \frac{0.5 \times 10^{6}}{\sqrt{3} \times 11 \times 10^{3}} \\ 
&= 26.24A \notag
\end{align}
For a remote fault, that is beyond the fuse, the fault current at Bus 4, 1270A
will flow through the fuse into the fault location. This would mean that the
fuse will operate in time less than *_0.01s_* as per the characteristics
mentioned in Table [[fuse]].
** Relay T
*** PSM
The current setting of the relay is selected based on the following criteria:
\begin{align}\label{eq:currentsetting}
(2 \times I_{maxLoad}) < I_{setting} < \frac{I_{fault}}{2} 
\end{align}
For a 2MW load, using \eqref{eq:loadcurrent}, maximum load current is 105A and
maximum fault current is 1270A. By equation \eqref{eq:currentsetting}, the
current setting I_{setting} is chosen as 325A, such that: 210A < I_{setting} <
635A. If I_{N} is the Rated primary current of the CT or the nominal current of
the CT:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:psm}
Plug Setting = \frac{I_{setting}}{I_{N}} \times 100%
\end{equation}
For a CT primary value of 100A,
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Plug setting chosen for relay T is 325%
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS
For I_N defined in the equation \eqref{eq:psm}, and if I is the fault current
seen on the primary of the CT, the operating time or standard characteristic
time of an IDMT relay is given by the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tms}
t = TMS \times \frac{0.14}{(\frac{I}{PSM \times I_N})^{0.02} -1}
\end{equation}
The minimum grading margin with respect to leaf node fuse is given by:
\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.01 + 0.5 s\\
&= 0.51s
\end{flalign*}
For t_{min}=0.51s, the minimum operating time for relay T for a remote fault
beyond the fuse, TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.101 and rounded off
to 0.1. The close in or local fault action time of the relay, for a maximum
fault current of 1587A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.434s.
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay T is 0.1 and operating time for local
fault is 0.434s
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
** Relay S and Relay R
*** PSM
The current setting of the relays S and R are selected using the equation
\eqref{eq:currentsetting}, and the plug setting are calculated using the
equation \eqref{eq:psm} as:

#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Plug setting for relay S and R is 550% and 725% respectively.
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS: Relay S
The minimum grading margin with respect to relay T's local fault action time is
given by:

\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.434 + 0.5 s\\
&= 0.934s
\end{flalign*}
For t_{min}=0.934s, the minimum operating time for relay S for a remote fault beyond the
Relay T, the TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.143 and rounded off to
0.15. The close in or local fault action time of the relay S, for a maximum fault
current of 2120A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.768s
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay S is 0.15 and operating time for local
fault is 0.768s
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS Relay R
The minimum grading margin with respect to relay S's local fault action time is
given by:

\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.768 + 0.5 s\\
&= 1.268s
\end{flalign*}
For t_{min}=1.268s, the minimum operating time for relay R for a remote fault
beyond the Relay S, the TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.196 and
rounded off to 0.2. The close in or local fault action time of the relay R, for
a maximum fault current of 3180A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms}
as 0.933s

#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay R is 0.2 and operating time for local
fault is 0.933s

** Observations
Following are the observations of relay coordination:
1. All relays operate _under a second_ for its respective local fault
2. The fuse characteristics is only given up to 480A of current, even though the
   maximum fault current seen at the bus to which fuse is connected is in range
   of thousands of Amperes. The horizontal line extends to higher currents at
   0.01 as fuse characteristic extrapolation
3. At 480A, the leaf node fuse is backed up by Relay T with 1.8s. As the current
   increases, the backup time reduces
4. At the local fault for relay T, at 1587A, the time of operation is 0.434s. It
   is backed up by relay S and R at 0.98s and 1.78s respectively
5. For relay S local fault at 2120A, the time of operation is 0.768s. It
   is backed up by relay R at 1.291s
6. Relay R local fault operation time is 0.933s
7. Downstream to upstream discrimination is at least 0.5s

The placement of Loads in the PSCAD model is different from the diagram
given. This is due to the position of free programmable blocks Is1, Is2 and Is3
used to measure the current input to relays. Also, the relay operation is not
affected with this placement of loads.

\end{equation}
Following the similar procedure as per standard inverse and using the above

*** Observations
1. For higher fault currents, fault location closer to the relays, the extreme
   inverse relay characteristics acts quicker with less operating time
2. For remote faults, extreme inverse characteristics takes more time to operate


\pagebreak
* Conclusions and Recommendations
Relay coordination for the system was performed and verified. The relay control
settings, PSM and TMS calculated are applied to understand the time/current
grading. Downstream fuse is backed-up by relays upstream. All relays operate
under a second for their respective close-in faults. The client network was
modelled in PSCAD software, and the calculated control settings were inputted
into the elements to verify the calculations. The software experiment procedures
and results are captured in section [[Standard Inverse Tests]].

Furthermore, the IDMT relay settings were calculated for Extreme Inverse
characteristic apart from Standard Inverse characteristic. Standard inverse
characteristic is recommended due to its quick operation time over a wide fault
current range. For the relays R, S and T given in the client network, from
upstream to downstream relays has PSM 325%, 550% and 725% chosen respectively.
The TMS for the above relays, in a standard inverse setting is identified as
0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 respectively. These settings are presented in table
[[idmtstandard]]. The software simulation and calculation are found to be
satisfactory for normal and faulty condition relay operations.
