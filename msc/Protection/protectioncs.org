* Executive Summary	10
Electrical Power System needs to be protected from abnormal occurrences or
faults. Different parts of the system are categorised into zones with primary
and backup protection equipment assigned for them. The protection devices have
built-in controls which needs to be set by the user for it to identify
faults. These settings are crucial because it helps discriminate between normal
condition and faulty condition, Backup protection not operate before primary
protection. Wrong settings could cause catastrophic failures like system
blackout or permanent damage to large power system assets and customer
equipment. It could also incorrectly disconnect a sect of customers at different
zones, causing Loss of Load Supplied. The study conducted in this project
identifies the correct relay settings for the system and discusses the merits
and disadvantages of different combinations.

In the given radial system, Over-Current protection is used to isolate the
faulty systems. Inverse Definite Minimum Time(IDMT) relays with Current
Transformers are used to measure, identify and trigger alarm signal during fault
conditions. A Circuit breaker receives the signal and acts upon it to isolate
affected part of the system from the rest. At the leaf node of the system fuses
act as primary protection. The upstream relays acts as backup protection for the
fuses and the downstream relays. The Plug Setting Multiplier and Time Multiplier
setting in relays

* Introduction	15
** Basic operation
Over Current Relay(OCR) protection is one of the oldest techniques in Power
System Protection. If the magnitude of the current flowing in the system is
above a certain threshold, the faulty section of the system is to be isolated
within a certain time frame. System current is measured using a Current
Transformer(CT), which reduces the current range to the relay
specifications. The secondary current of the CT is passed through a coil. The
current carrying coil induces a magnetic field which produces a mechanical
torque on a metallic disc prodding it into rotational motion. The mechanical
torque on the disc is proportional to the magnetic field, which is proportional
to the current the coil is carrying. During fault conditions, the moving disc is
expected to make contact with the tripping lead by overcoming the restraining
torque of the attached spring. Under normal operating conditions, the
restraining spring holds the disc. 
** Time and Distance
The aforementioned type of OCR is an instantaneous one. Further delay to relay
operations can be introduced by increasing the time taken to energise the relay
disc or by increasing the distance between disc contact and tripping lead. The
former is achieved by adding resistance in front of the relay coil, forcing it
to demand more current from the CT to operate, and the latter is achieved by
placing the tripping lead farther away from the disc contact. These settings are
conventionally called as Plug Setting Multiplier(PSM) and Time Multiplier Setting
(TMS) respectively.

** Important Assumptions
1. Higher values(above hundred) of current are rounded off to first significant figure
2. Upstream relays are graded with respect to immediate downstream relays rather
   than the fuses
** Fuse Characteristics

** Maximum Fault Current 
For a 11kV system, the maximum fault current at each bus, where X_n is the
magnitude of Thevinin impedance at the bus n, is calculated using the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
I_f = \frac{11000 \times 0.5774}{X_n}
\end{equation}
#+caption: Maximum fault current at each bus

| Bus number | Current (A) |

|          2 |        2120 |
|          1 |        3180 |
|------------+-------------|
** Fuse at leaf node
For a load of 0.5MW @ 11kV and assuming a resistive load the max load current is
given by, 

\begin{align}
I_{fusemax} 
&= \frac{0.5 \times 10^{6}}{\sqrt{3} \times 11 \times 10^{3}} \\
&= 26.24A \notag
\end{align}

For a remote fault, that is beyond the fuse, the fault current at Bus 4, 1270A
will flow through the fuse into the fault location. This would mean that the
fuse will operate in time less than *_0.01s_* as per the characteristics
mentioned in Table [[fuse]].
** Relay T
*** PSM
The current setting of the relay is selected based on the following criteria:
\begin{align}\label{eq:currentsetting}
(2 \times I_{maxLoad}) < I_{setting} < \frac{I_{fault}}{2} 
\end{align}

Maximum load current is 105A and maximum fault current is 1270A. By equation
\eqref{eq:currentsetting}, the current setting I_{setting} is chosen as 225A,
such that: 210A < I_{setting} < 635A. If I_{N} is the Rated primary current
of the CT or the nominal current of the CT:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:psm}
Plug Setting = \frac{I_{setting}}{I_{N}} \times 100%
\end{equation}


For a CT primary value of 100A,
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Plug setting chosen for relay T is 325%
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS
For I_N defined in the equation \eqref{eq:psm}, and if I is the fault current
seen on the primary of the CT, the operating time or standard characteristic
time of an IDMT relay is given by the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tms}
t = TMS \times \frac{0.14}{(\frac{I}{PSM \times I_N})^{0.02} -1}
\end{equation}

The minimum grading margin with respect to leaf node fuse is given by:
\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.01 + 0.5 s\\
&= 0.51s
\end{flalign*}

For t_{min}=0.51s, the minimum operating time for relay T for a remote fault
beyond the fuse, TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.101 and rounded off
to 0.1. The close in or local fault action time of the relay, for a maximum
fault current of 1587A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.434s.
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay T is 0.1 and operating time for local
fault is 0.434s
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
** Relay S and Relay R
*** PSM
The current setting of the relays S and R are selected using the equation
\eqref{eq:currentsetting}, and the plug setting are calculated using the
equation \eqref{eq:psm} as:

#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Plug setting for relay S and R is 550% and 725% respectively.
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS: Relay S
The minimum grading margin with respect to relay T's local fault action time is
given by:

\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.434 + 0.5 s\\
&= 0.934s
\end{flalign*}

For t_{min}=0.934s, the minimum operating time for relay S for a remote fault beyond the
Relay T, the TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.143 and rounded off to
0.15. The close in or local fault action time of the relay S, for a maximum fault
current of 2120A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.768s
#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay S is 0.15 and operating time for local
fault is 0.768s
--------------------------------------------------
#+END_center
*** TMS Relay R
The minimum grading margin with respect to relay S's local fault action time is
given by:

\begin{flalign*}
t_{min}
&= 0.768 + 0.5 s\\
&= 1.268s
\end{flalign*}

For t_{min}=1.268s, the minimum operating time for relay R for a remote fault beyond the
Relay S, the TMS is calculated from \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.196 and rounded off to 0.2.

The close in or local fault action time of the relay R, for a maximum fault
current of 3180A is calculated from the equation \eqref{eq:tms} as 0.933s

#+BEGIN_center
--------------------------------------------------
Time multiplier setting chosen for relay R is 0.2 and operating time for local
fault is 0.933s
