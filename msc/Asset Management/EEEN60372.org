** Python Program
A Python program with all the calculations for tower design can be found at: [[https://github.com/vinodhmj/projects/blob/f05b1347b5cc9357650d387a34d9603f98e77437/msc/ohl.py][EEEN60372_OHL_Coursework.py]]
* Power Rating Calculations
Thermal Rating of a conductor, also known as Power Rating, is calculated using
its current carrying capacity at maximum operating temperature. “The ampacity of
a conductor is that current which will meet the design, security and safety
criteria of a particular line on which the conductor is used.” (Stephen, [[References][1992]])
This is calculated using the law of conservation of thermal energy. The balance
between Heat gain(caused by Ohmic losses and Solar heating) and Heat loss(due to
atmospheric conditions and wind) is equated, and current value is obtained from
the following equation:

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:ampacity}
  I = \sqrt{\frac{q_c + q_r - q_s}{R_{TC}}}
\end{equation}
where, \\
  q_c = \text{Convection heat loss}, W/m \\
q_r = \text{Radiated heat loss}, W/m \\
q_s = \text{Solar heat gain}, W/m \\
I = \text{Conductor current}, Amperes \\
  R_T_C = \text{AC conductor resistance at maximum operating temperature},
\si{\ohm}/m \\

The MVA Rating can be calculated from the following equation:

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:mvarating}
  MVA_{Rated} = \sqrt{3} * V_r * I * N_c * 1e^{-06}
  \end{equation}
** Results
Substituting values from [[design-data][Table 1]] and [[design-data-conductor][Table 2]] on the above equations, and
rounding off to nearest whole number fetches the following results:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mvaresults}
MVA Rating = 781.483 \approxeq 780 MVA
\end{equation}

* Tower Diagram
This design schematic shown below is a hybrid model where the left hand side of
the vertical purple axis shows the values for a conventional Pin-cap type glass
insulator whereas the right hand side design shows the values for Polymer rod
type insulator. The external clearances are same for both cases. All
measurements labeled are physical dimensions validated against electrical
clearances.

* Internal Clearance Calculations - Top Tower Geometry
The internal clearance calculations for Top tower design is done here.
** Insulator Length - U160BLP
The primary insulator design uses a Pin-Cap type glass insulator U160BLP.
An alternate design using a polymer rod type insulator. The calculations,
results and comparison is provided in a section below.

| U160BLP Spacing, P_{u160}           | 0.17m  |
|-------------------------------------+--------|

The number of discs required for insulator is calculated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nDiscs}
N_{discs} = ceil(\frac{D_{cr}}{D_{u160}})
\end{equation}

The length of insulator is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lins}
D_{insulator} = N_{discs} * P_{u160}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
D_{insulator} = 3.74m
\end{align}
** Gap Factor, K
The gap factor K in the equations is used to describe the shape of the
electrodes across the gap, d, (in meters). [[References][Ref:3]]. "The air gaps, filled or not
with insulators, are of the self-restoring type. The geome- trical configuration
of the gap influences its withstand capability." [[References][(CIGRE Green Books)]].
"Ground level electric and magnetic field effects of overhead power lines have
become of increasing concern as transmission voltages are increased. The
electric fields are especially important because their effects on human beings
and animals have been a concern in the last decades.  Serious views still exist
that prolonged exposure to electric and magnetic fields could be associated with
adverse health effects or with increased risks. However, it is not appropriate
to consider unlikely conditions when setting and applying electric field safety
criteria because of pos- sible consequences; thus statistical considerations are
necessary",[[References][(CIGRE Green Books)]].

\pagebreak

In this design, two Gap factors are considered,
1. For Phase-Ground calculations, K = 1.45, without insulator
   - This corresponds to Conductor-Body of the tower and Conductor-Crossarms
   - Flashover possibility due to pollution on insulators is assumed to have
     less impact
2. For Phase-Phase calculations, K = 1.4, without insulator
   - This accounts for rod-rod electrodes separated by air dielctric

** Clearances
The three major electrical clearances are as follows:
1. AC voltage clearance is associated with the peak voltage through the conductor
2. Switching impulse is caused by faults and switchgear operation
3. Lightning impulse calculations are done for a direct lightning hit on the conductor or electrode.

IEC 60071-1 standards suggest standard RMS voltage of 300kV for Electrical
clearance calculation.
#+caption: Standard Insulation [2]
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm :center t
[[./standardInsulation.png]]

*** Phase – Ground (P-G) Clearances
As per figure 2, following values are used for clearance calculations:
\begin{align}
\text{Highest Voltage for equipment, (RMS value),} U_{50-AC} = 300kV \\
\text{Switching impulse withstand voltage, Phase-to-earth kV (peak),} U_{50-SI} = 750kV \\
\text{Lightning impulse withstand voltage kV (peak),} U_{50-LI} = 850kV
\end{align}

The AC peak value is calculated by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u50}
U_{50} = \sqrt{3} * U_{50-AC} kV
\end{equation}

The AC, Lightning and Switching Voltage clearances in meters are calculated as follows:

\begin{align}\label{eq:clearances}
D_{ac} = \frac{8 * U_{50-AC}}{3740 * K - U_{50-AC}} \\ \label{eq:clearances1}
D_{li} = \frac{U_{50-LI}}{380 + (150 * K)} \\ \label{eq:clearances2}
D_{si} = \frac{8 * U_{50-SI}}{3400 * K - U_{50-SI}} \\ \label{eq:clearances3}
D_{el} = max(D_{ac}, D_{li}, D{si})
\end{align}
*** Phase – Phase (P-P) Clearances
As per figure 2, following values are used for clearance calculations:
\begin{align}
\text{Highest Voltage for equipment, (RMS value),} U_{50-AC} = 300kV \\
\text{Switching impulse withstand voltage, Phase-to-earth kV (peak),} U_{50-SI} = 1.5 * 750kV \approxeq 1125kV \\
\text{Lightning impulse withstand voltage kV (peak),} U_{50-LI} = 1.5 * 850kV \approxeq 1270kV
\end{align}
*** Results
**** Phase - Ground
By using a Gap Factor K = 1.45, \\
Following are the values for clearances

|-----------+----------|
| Parameter | Value, m |
|-----------+----------|
| D_{ac}    |    0.679 |
| D_{li}    |    1.423 |
| D_{si}    |    1.435 |
| D_{el}    |    1.435 |
|-----------+----------|

\begin{align}
D_{el} = 1.435m
\end{align}
**** Phase to Phase
Using the \eqref{eq:clearances}, \eqref{eq:clearances1}, \eqref{eq:clearances2},
\eqref{eq:clearances3} and a Gap Factor K = 1.4 The phase to phase clearance
values are calculated as:
|-----------+----------|
| Parameter | Value, m |
|-----------+----------|
| D_{ac-PP} |    0.679 |
| D_{li-PP} |    2.153 |
| D_{si-PP} |    2.476 |
| D_{el-PP} |    2.476 |
|-----------+----------|

\begin{align}
D_{el-PP} = 2.476m + 1.5m(Conductor galloping) = 3.976m
\end{align}
** Swing Angle
#+CAPTION: Swing Angle
#+LABEL: swingangle
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./swing.png]]

Swing Angle is required to calculate the minimum distance required for Phase to
ground electrical clearance. The primary factor in Swing angle is the horizontal
force acted on the conductor system due to wind. In the calculation below, the
weight of insulators is neglected and a simplified diagram is shown in the
figure above. Following are the calculations for swing angle:

Force due to wind on conductors, F_w, is given by:
\begin{equation}
F_w = \frac{1}{2} * V^{2} * D_{cond} * L_s * N_{cb}
\end{equation}
where, N_{cb} = Number of conductors in the bundle

Force due to gravity on the conductors, F_g, is given by:
\begin{equation}
F_g = M_c * 9.81 m/s
\end{equation}

Swing Angle, \phi_s is then calculated using:
\begin{equation}
\phi_s = tan {}^{-1} (\frac{Fw}{Fg})
\end{equation}
*** Results
Substituting values from [[design-data][Table 1]] and [[design-data-conductor][Table 2]] on the above equations,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:swingvalue}
\theta_{swing} = 23.113^o
\end{equation}
** Cross arm
*** Length of crossarms
The length of crossarms has a critical role in maintaining the minimum
Phase-Ground clearance between swinging conductors and the body of the
tower. Shown in [[fig:crossarm][Figure 5]] , the length of cross arm is calculated using:
\begin{align}\label{eq:crossarm}
L_{crossarm} = L_{displacement} + D_{el} \\
L_{displacement} = \sin{\phi_s} * L_{hanging} \\
L_{hanging} = D_{insulator} + L_{fitting} + D_{cond}
\end{align}
*** Distance between crossarms
#+CAPTION: Crossarm distances
#+LABEL: crossarm
#+NAME:  fig:crossarm
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.32\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./crossarm.png]]

The distance between crossarms is calculated in sync with minimum electrical
phase to ground and phase to phase clearances. Distance between Cross arms is
calculated using:

\begin{align}\label{eq:cadistance}
D_{ca-top-mid} = \frac{D_{hanging} + D_{el}}{\sin{\theta_{12}}} \\
D_{ca-mid-bottom} =  \frac{D_{hanging} + D_{el}}{\sin{\theta_{23}}}
\end{align}
*** Results
Substituting values from [[design-data][Table 1]], [[design-data-conductor][Table 2]] and [[design-data-insulator][Table 3]] on the above equations,
|-------------------+--------|
| L_{crossarm}      | 3.053m |
| D_{ca-top-mid}    | 5.681m |
| D_{ca-mid-bottom} | 5.727m |
|-------------------+--------|

** Shield wire
The distance to shield wire mount at an angle of 30^o from top cross arm is calculated by:
\begin{align}
D_{ca-shield} = \frac{L_{crossarm} + \frac{W_t}{2}}{\tan(\theta_{shield}) - L_{hanging}}
\end{align}
*** Results
\begin{equation}
D_{ca-shield} = 3.505m
\end{equation}
** Alternate Insulator Design
Considering the required Creepage for the tower is 11.6m, S248142V7 polymer type
insulator is used. The technical details for this insulator is given below:

\begin{align}
D_{el} = 3.272m
D_{insulator} = 3.607m
\end{align}
*** Results
Using the \eqref{eq:crossarm}, \eqref{eq:cadistance}, Substituting values from [[design-data][Table 1]], [[design-data-conductor][Table 2]] and [[design-data-polymer-insulator][Table 4]] on the above equations,
|-------------------+--------|
| L_{crossarm}      | 3.053m |

* External Clearance Calculations – Tower Legs Geometry
** Sag Calculation
#+CAPTION: Sag. [5]
#+LABEL: sag
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.3\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./sag.png]]
The property of metallic malleable adds to conductor elasticity which results in
a sag within a span of two towers. Elasticity coupled with atmospheric
temperature increases the sag towards earth at the middle. Sag could be
calculated using the following formula:
*** Length of Conductor across span
The length of the conductor with elasticity is given by:
\begin{align}\label{eq:condLength}
L_c = L_s + \frac{W^{2} * L_s^{3}}{24T^{2}} m \\
W = M_c * 9.81 N/m \\
T = 0.2 * T_r N
\end{align}

where, \\
L_c = conductor length within a span, m \\
W = conductor weight N/m \\
T = Tensile Strength at installed capacity(20%), N
*** Thermal Elongation
The maximum length of conductor including thermal elongation is calculated by:
\begin{equation}
L_{thermalElongation} = \varepsilon_t * (T_{max} - T_{installed}) * L_c m
\end{equation}
*** Maximum Sag 
The maximum sag is then calculated by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sag}
Sag_{max} = \sqrt{ \frac{3L_sL_c - 3L_s^{2}}{8}}
\end{equation}
*** Results
Substituting values from [[design-data][Table 1]] and [[design-data-conductor][Table 2]] in the above equations:
|-----------------------+-----------|
| L_c                   | 366.429m  |
| L_{thermalElongation} | 367.0193m |
| Sag_{max}             | 11.828m   |
| D_{ca-shield}         | 3.48m     |
|-----------------------+-----------|
** Ground Clearance
The ground clearance from the point of maximum conductor sag is applied from
standards in United Kingdom. [[References][Ref:3]]

\begin{align}
Ground Clearance(No Road) = 7.0m \\
Ground Clearance(Road) = 7.4m
\end{align}

\pagebreak
* Discussion and Conclusion
The design of any Overhead Transmission tower must consider a primary factor of
Geography. In the northern part of England, in United Kingdom(UK), the terrain,
weather, population, urban/rural planning has to be considered. UK has a set
certain Standards and Laws and Regulations for laying out a transmission tower
from one point to another. These are to be followed at planning stage. The
atmospheric Condition; wind speed, temperature, humidity, wetness, and pollution
plays and important role in the Electro-mechanical design of the tower and its
components and accessories. Safety is of paramount importance. Critical
Infrastructure, Housing in the path of the tower is to be considered. Presence
of natural elements like river, forest, etc. will add to safety parameters.


Technically, the MVA/Thermal Rating determines how much power can be evacuated
through the line. This depends of Generation, Load distribution and contingency
analysis. Once this is identified then critical factors of normal and abnormal
operating conditions are characterized in the design. Flashover voltage
withstand capacity among dielectrics(air/insulator) are to be considered. Gap
Factor between electrodes play a significant role in determining the electrical
clearances. Gap factor choice is usually set conservative as safety is the
utmost priority. Risk of failure of dielectrics to withstand abnormal conditions
affect the calculation of clearances. Environmental factors affect the choice of
gap factor. Corona losses (CL), radio interference (RI) and audible noise (AN)
are usually considered with respect the design of transmission system, but are
ignored in this design.


Insulators, two types are used in this design. A conventional Pin & Cap type
glass insulator and a modern polymer rod insulator. The tower design improved
with the use of Polymer insulator in terms of Insulator length, Cross arm length
and distance between cross arms. This would mean less materials are required for
construction and the cost would significantly come down. "It has been noted that
the results of failure of polymer insulators can be more significant than that
of hardened glass insulators.  But the recent failure rates and life expectancy
of later generation polymer insulators, while not at the same level of hardened
glass insulators, more than make up for the difference in cost.", [[References][(Philips)]]
As an alternative to the polymeric insulator currently used, a fiber glass core
with silicone rubber petticoat could be used for this design. This would provide
the tensile strength and flashover withstanding capacity as well.

In external clearances, the conductor galloping tendency at extreme weather,
causing the conductors to vibrate vertically is assumed to be harmless to the
maximum sag. The movement of vibration is expected to reduce the sag level. The
use of a spacer or damper could reduce the impact of vibrations.
